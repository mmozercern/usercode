How to reproduce the plots from the TeVMu+HEEP meeting on the 25th Aug. 09

1) compile the RooFit-code as described in README.txt

2) in root:
.x HEEP HEEPStyle_noTitle.C  // this various plot options
.x loadlib.C                 // load the model and dataset libraries
.L papersig.C+		     // this will set the various parameters to the choices of the early paper
.L opt.C		     // just some auxilliary scrip to save some typing
test("e_0_3.txt","e_40_43.txt") // the two input files contain the pseudoexperiments for
                             // the electron and muon channels
                             // the macro will scan the likelihood and print the 
                             // Z-values of the single channel and combined fits
.x plonll.C                  // produce the various plots from the output of the previous fitting
                             // you need to re-run the "test(char*,char*)" function before you run
                             // this again to properly reset all the fixed/floating parameters.
